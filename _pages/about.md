<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in a joint training program between the School of Advanced Interdisciplinary Sciences and the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am majoring in Computer Science and Technology. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree from the Central University of Finance and Economics.

My research interests focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Multi-Agent Systems**, and **Misinformation Detection**.

[Beyond Detection: Exploring Evidence-based Multi-Agent Debate for Misinformation Intervention and Persuasion](https://github.com/hanshenmesen/Debate-to-Detect)

**Chen Han**, et al.

- Proposed an Evidence-based Multi-Agent Debate (ED2D) framework to address LLM hallucinations by introducing an Evidence Function Call for retrieving external knowledge (Wikipedia).
- Demonstrated that ED2D not only detects misinformation but also serves as a persuasive system to correct user misconceptions.

[Debate-to-Detect: Reformulating Misinformation Detection as a Real-World Debate with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18596)

**Chen Han**, et al.

- Reformulated misinformation detection as a multi-agent debate task, simulating real-world fact-checking processes to enhance reasoning interpretability and transparency.
- Outperformed existing baselines on two mainstream fake news datasets.
