<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in a joint program between the School of Advanced Interdisciplinary Sciences and the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests focus on **Large Language Models**, **Multi-Agent Systems**, and **Misinformation Detection**.

Outside of research, I am also a Top 500 Tank player in Overwatch :D.

[Beyond Detection: Exploring Evidence-based Multi-Agent Debate for Misinformation Intervention and Persuasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07267)

**Chen Han**, Yijia Ma, Jin Tan, Wenzhen Zheng, Xijin Tang

- Proposed an Evidence-based Multi-Agent Debate (ED2D) framework to address LLM hallucinations by introducing an Evidence Function Call for retrieving external knowledge (Wikipedia).
- Demonstrated that ED2D not only detects misinformation but also serves as a persuasive system to correct user misconceptions.
